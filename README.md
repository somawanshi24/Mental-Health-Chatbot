# 🧠 Mental Health Chatbot  
A conversational AI that supports mental well-being through empathetic interaction.

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates how NLP-powered chatbots can support users experiencing emotional distress by offering relevant resources, encouraging reflection, and maintaining respectful dialogue.  
Built using Python and key libraries.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Provide basic emotional support via conversational AI  
- Use NLP techniques to identify user sentiment and mental states  
- Suggest helpful resources and coping strategies based on user input

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- 
## 📂 Folder Structure  

## 📈 Workflow  
1. Data preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal)  
2. Sentiment detection using rule-based or ML classifier  
3. Intent recognition and response generation  
4. Suggest resources based on emotional cues

## 🖥️ Demo

_Example: Chatbot offering support for a different emotional cue._

## 💬 Sample Chat Flow  

**User:** I'm feeling really low today.  
**Bot:** I'm sorry you're feeling that way. You're not alone—would you like to talk about it or get some calming techniques?

**User:** I'm actually in a good mood!  
**Bot:** That's great to hear! Remember, even a small smile can spread positivity.
