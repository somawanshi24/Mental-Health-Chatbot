# 🧠 Mental Health Chatbot  
*A conversational AI that supports mental well-being through empathetic interaction.*

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates how NLP-powered chatbots can support users experiencing emotional distress by offering relevant resources, encouraging reflection, and maintaining respectful dialogue.  
Built using Python and key libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Provide basic emotional support via conversational AI  
- Use NLP techniques to identify user sentiment and mental states  
- Suggest helpful resources and coping strategies based on user input

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Flask (optional, for web deployment)  
- Regex + basic ML models

## 📂 Folder Structure  

## 📈 Workflow  
1. Data preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal)  
2. Sentiment detection using rule-based or ML classifier  
3. Intent recognition and response generation  
4. Suggest resources based on emotional cues
